# Roman Numerals

This project is here to help you convert from our [Arabic Decimal System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduâ€“Arabic_numeral_system) to the [Roman Numeral System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals), and vice versa.

You can start this project in a **Docker Development Environment** by [clicking this link](https://open.docker.com/dashboard/dev-envs?url=git@github.com:ferdinandkeller/roman-numerals.git).

If you encounter any problems using this library, do not hesitate to contact me.
